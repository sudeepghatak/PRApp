          Anything that is tangible and has a useful life of one year or greater
          with individual value of $5,000.00 or greater. You need to obtain a
          CIP number from the FA Admin and a UFID number from FP&A. The UFID
          number informs the FA Admin that the purchase of the asset has been
          approved and that the FA Admin can go ahead and issue the CIP number.
          The CIP is needed to make sure that the purchase will be properly
          recorded as an asset.
